            <p>
                You retain ownership of the content you create in the App (such as notes and journal entries). However, you
                grant us a limited license to process that content solely to provide App features you use (for example, generating
                AI coaching responses when you choose to use the AI coaching feature).

            <h2>8. Availability, Changes, and Termination</h2>
            <p>
                We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App (or any part of it) at any time. We may also update these Terms
                from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p class="muted">
                The App is provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including
                implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant

            </p>

            <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p class="muted">
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, Rich Code Studio shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
                special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising out of or related to your
                use of the App.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>

                losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of your use of the App or violation of
                these Terms.

                conflict of law principles. (If you prefer, replace this with your specific state/country.)
